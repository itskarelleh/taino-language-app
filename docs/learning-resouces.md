# Learning Resources
Some resources that I've found helpful in learning about the technologies used in this project.
## Frontend

Using React Native and Expo
You definitely want to use the React Native docs for learning the syntax and concepts of React Native.
But when it comes to things like pages, setup, you'll want to look at Expo docs.

Expo Docs: https://docs.expo.dev/
React Native Docs: https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started

React Native Elements: https://reactnativeelements.com/docs/

## Backend

NestJS may seem intimidating at first, but it's really just a framework for NodeJS. If you've done any type of OOP programming, you'll find it quite easy to pick up.

NestJS Docs: https://docs.nestjs.com/

Some useful commands that I've found helpful:

```bash
# create a new controller
nest g controller controller-name

# create a new service
nest g service service-name

# create a new module
nest g module module-name
```

## Testing
Unit testing for both the frontend and backend is done with Jest.

## Deployment (WIP)
